# card-matching-game
My goal was to learn JavaScript by doing this game and thanks to this game i've build dynamic states for the first time.
While i do that, i also improved my HTML and CSS skills either.

You can see the finished state at http://memorycardgame.orgfree.com/ (For the best experience i recommend to play it on Google Chrome).

Have fun! ðŸ¥³
